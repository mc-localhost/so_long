so_long is a 42 project aimed at developing a mini 2D game by utilizing the school's graphical library. the objectives of the project can be found in [en.subject.pdf](./en.subject.pdf) file

the game design was inspired by [this legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo_Deng) and drawn using procreate

## the rules

* the extension must be `.ber`
* the map must be rectangular and surrounded by a wall made of `1`
* there must be only 1 player (`P`), 1 exit (`E`), and at least 1 collectable (`C`). the rest of the map would be tiles (`0`)
