so_long is a 42 project aimed at developing a mini 2D game by utilizing the school's graphical library. the objectives of the project can be found in [en.subject.pdf](./en.subject.pdf) file

the game design was inspired by [this legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo_Deng) and drawn using procreate

## the rules
the map has to satisfy a number of simple conditions:
* the extension must be `.ber`
* the map must be rectangular and surrounded by a wall made of `1`
* there must be only 1 player (`P`), 1 exit (`E`), and at least 1 collectable (`C`). the rest of the map would be tiles (`0`)

in order to win one needs to move the hero (hippo) to pick up all collectables (boots) and exit through the exit tile (bathtub). the player can use WASD or arrow keys to move
